I am a Second-Year Ph.D. student at Northeastern_CAMD. , advised by Prof. [Eileen McGivney](https://scholar.harvard.edu/mcgivney). My research interest lies in the interdisciplinary area of Human-Computer Interaction+XR+Education Computing in designing the XR System to help teacher in their Decision-Making and Hybrid Communication to foster an equitable, inclusive, and effective learning context. I plan to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into the XR context to make every interactive educational element smart, memorable, and personable, adapting it to truly individualized and tailor-made learning.
